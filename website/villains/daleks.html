			        <TD><h1>Daleks</h1>
			          <p>Daleks were the armoured, mutated descendants of the Kaleds of the planet   Skaro. They fought the Time Lords in the Last Great Time War, ending in the   near-total destruction of both races. The Daleks were hated and feared   throughout time and space. They were the oldest and most frequent foes of the   Doctor, having faced him several times in every one of his incarnations.</p>
			          <p><BR>
		              Although the Daleks looked entirely   robotic, they were in fact cybernetic organisms or cyborgs, with a biological   body encased in and supported by a protective outer shell of Dalekanium metal   armour, armed and mobile. These were actually the Mark III travel machines   designed to carry their mutant forms, and they were not true integrated   biomechanoids. (AUDIO: The Four Doctors) In this respect, they were somewhat   similar to a Cyberman; unlike them, however, the Daleks' bodies had mutated so   drastically from their Kaled ancestors they had lost all humanoid appearance,   save for one eye (see below). (TV: The Daleks, Evolution of the Daleks) The   Daleks shared information using a sort of artificial telepathic network known as   the Pathweb. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks)</p>
			          <p><BR>
			            The Dalek casing, originally called a "Mark   III travel machine", (TV: Genesis of the Daleks) could be separated into three   sections.</p>
			          <p>Top: The Dalek's means of vision and communication, a dome with a set of twin   speaker 'lights' (referred to as luminosity dischargers). (PROSE: Prisoner of   the Daleks) On the upper part of the sides and a telescope-like eyestalk in the   middle. This was attached to the mid-section by a "neck".<BR>
			            Midsection: On the   Dalek's midsection, the gunstick and manipulator arm were attached. These   provided the Dalek's means of offence and operating capabilities. In later   models, the midsection was capable of swiveling.<BR>
		            Bottom: The Dalek's means of   mobility was a sturdy base with a skirt-like structure of plates studded with   globes. This allowed movement and, in later models, flight.</p></TD>
