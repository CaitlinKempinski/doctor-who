			        <TD><h1>Weeping Angels</h1>
			          <p>The Weeping Angels were a species of quantum-locked humanoids, so called   because their unique nature necessitated that they often covered their faces   with their hands to prevent trapping each other in petrified form for eternity   by looking at one another. This gave the Weeping Angels their distinct "weeping"   appearance. They were known for being murderous psychopaths, eradicating their   victims "mercifully" by dropping them into the past and letting them live out   their full lives, just in a different time period. This, in turn, allowed them   to live off the remaining time energy of the victim's life. However, when this   potential energy paled in comparison to an alternative power source to feed on,   the Angels were known to kill by other means, such as snapping their victims'   necks.</p>

		              Weeping Angels that were   converted from ordinary statues appeared as they did before being taken over,   and other Angels resembled stone statues of winged, humanoid women in chitons.   Baby Angels resembled cherubs â€” naked, infant-sized versions of adult Angels.   Baby angels possessed the same traits as the others, but when they aren't seen,   their footsteps and child-like giggles can be heard. (TV: The Angels Take   Manhattan) When showing ferocity, Weeping Angels would bare their fangs and   claws. (TV: Blink)</p>

		              When Weeping Angels became older and/or grew weaker or by   starvation, they wore away as a statue would over many years. This wearing could   become so severe that they might not look like their original forms anymore,   losing their wings and becoming more like a typical statue of great age. These   older Weeping Angels did not have the same speed as their "healthy"   counterparts, but were just as deadly. They could regain their appearance if   re-energised (fed). A single hour was all it would take. (TV: The Time of   Angels)</p></TD>
