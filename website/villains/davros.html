			        <TD><h1>Davros</h1>
			          <p>Davros was originally the head of the Kaled Scientific Elite, on the planet   Skaro, but became better known as the creator of the Daleks. During the   Imperial-Renegade Dalek Civil War, he served as Emperor of the Imperial Dalek   faction and later of the Dalek race as a whole, but his relationship with his   creations was always tense. He was frequently hunted, maligned or otherwise   denigrated by some portion of the overall Dalek population.</p>
			          <p>Despite the fact that he was not the unquestioned ruler of the Daleks, he was   one of the Doctor's greatest enemies, rivalling the Master in intellect and   madness. Because of his creations, he was responsible for trillions of deaths   and war across the universe.</p>

			            Early life edit<BR>
		            Davros was born in the   later part of the Thousand Year War between the Kaleds and the Thals on the   planet Skaro, the issue of an adulterous relationship between Lady Calcula and   Councillor Quested. He had an elder half-sister, Yarvell. It was a time when   mercy and nobility were all but non-existent on Skaro and life was harsh and   grim. The use of nuclear weapons and other agents of mutation produced Mutos,   who resided in the Wastelands and were often used for slave labour by both the   Kaleds and the Thals.</p></TD>
