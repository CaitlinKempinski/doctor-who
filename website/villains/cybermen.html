			        <TD><h1>Cyberman</h1>
			          <p>Cybermen were a "race" of cybernetically augmented humanoids. They varied   greatly in design, with different factions throughout time and space. The two   major groups, from which all other known versions derived, were the Mondasian   Cybermen, which originated on the planet Mondas – Earth's twin planet in the   Doctor's universe – and the Cybermen created by Cybus Industries, which   originated on Earth in an alternate universe.</p>
			          <p>Despite the different origins, there were similarities between both groups of   Cybermen, and there were groups that shared the characteristics of both. For the   most part, they lacked individuality or names. Cybermen had no emotions and   viewed them as a weakness. They frequently attempted to physically and mentally   re-engineer humans and other humanoids into Cybermen, via a process called   "cyber-conversion" or "upgrading".</p>

	                These Cybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids   who originated on Earth's former twin planet, Mondas. Mondas drifted into the   outer solar system. To survive, the natives of that world adapted by turning   themselves into cyborgs. (TV: The Tenth Planet) Eventually, all of the   Mondasians underwent cyber-conversion. (AUDIO: Spare Parts) Many of them left   Mondas and ultimately developed into separate groups without connection to one   another.</p></TD>
