			        <TD><h1>Lady Christina de Souza</h1>
			          <p>Lady Christina de Souza was a friend of the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors, and   had brief adventures with them both. A minor member of the British aristocracy,   she was also a thief and an adrenaline junkie. Her exploits were well-publicised   — at least in Britain — allowing Rory Williams to recognise her on sight.</p>
			          <p>Biography edit<BR>
		              Christina de Souza was a notorious thief who stole for   thrill, rather than profit as most thieves would; she was bored with her   aristocratic upbringing. When she met the Tenth Doctor, Christina had already   built a considerable reputation and was relentlessly pursued by Detective   Inspector Macmillan.</p>
		            <p>At Easter 2009, she stole the prized Cup of Athelstan from the International   Gallery in London. Her calling card (a mechanical golden Maneki Neko waving in a   mocking manner) alerted the guards to her presence and her associate was quickly   found and arrested, which concerned Christina not at all. Unable to find a way   to distance herself from the museum because of the many police officers about,   she used the 200 bus as an escape vehicle, bribing the driver with her diamond   earrings for passage. When she met the Doctor, she dismissed him due to his odd   behaviour. Once the bus was caught in a wormhole and deposited on an alien   planet, she established herself as the leader of the group. She deferred to the   Doctor's knowledge, recognising his understanding of the situation. The many   tools in her backpack, which included a shovel to dig out the bus wheels, a   hatchet to cut away the seats (so they could be used as traction for the   wheels), a mechanical winch for her heists and a hammer, proved to be of   enormous value to the   group.</p></TD>
