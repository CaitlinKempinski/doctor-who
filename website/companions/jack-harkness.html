			        <TD><h1>Jack Harness</h1>
			          <p>"Captain Jack Harkness" was the alias adopted by a Time Agent and con man   from the 51st century who became an associate and occasional companion of the   Doctor.</p>
			          <p>After he was killed by a Dalek, he was revived by Rose Tyler, who at the time   was transformed into a nearly omnipotent being. Unable to control her powers,   she accidentally turned him into an immortal being. Because of this, the Ninth   Doctor saw his companion as a fixed point — a temporal paradox that threatened   the TARDIS' proper operation. Consequently, the Doctor abandoned him in the year   200,100 aboard a space station orbiting a Dalek-devastated Earth.</p>
		            <p>Stranded, the former Time Agent had to use his own devices to catch up to the   Doctor. He thought it likely that he'd find the Ninth Doctor in the early 21st   century, since that was Rose's home era. But his vortex manipulator failed to   deliver him there, missing by more than a century — and going on the fritz   immediately thereafter. This left the immortal no choice but to simply wait from   the mid-19th to the early 21st century to reconnect with the Doctor.</p></TD>
