			  <h1>River Song</h1>
			  <p>"River Song", the primary alias of the third incarnation of Melody Pond, was   a "child of the TARDIS" and a known wife of the Eleventh Doctor. She was human   with Time Lord characteristics, conceived by her parents, Amy Pond and Rory   Williams, aboard the TARDIS as it travelled through the time vortex, and then   conditioned by the Silence. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War) This gave her great   strength, the ability to regenerate and a great understanding of the complex   principles of time and space. (TV: The Time of Angels, Day of the Moon, A Good   Man Goes to War, The Wedding of River Song) She loved the Doctor, and shared a   long-lasting relationship with him. River was one of the very few people who   knew the Doctor's true name. (TV: Forest of the Dead, The Name of the   Doctor)</p>
              <p>Melody was stolen from her parents as an infant by Madame Kovarian to become   a weapon of the Silence in their war against the Doctor. After potentially her   second regeneration, she killed the Eleventh Doctor, but then broke her mental   conditioning to give her remaining regenerations to revive his corpse. (TV:   Let's Kill Hitler)</p>
              <p>The Doctor and her parents left her to make her own way in the universe. With   no connection to her family or the Silence, River became an archaeologist,   ostensibly to track the Doctor through time. She crossed the Doctor's path on   several occasions, generally with the result that she was meeting him at   progressively earlier points in his own Time stream. Hoping to avoid temporal   paradoxes, the Doctor gave her a diary to keep track of their meetings and to   prevent her from revealing "spoilers" to him about his own future</p>
