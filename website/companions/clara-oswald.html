			        <TD><h1>Clara Oswald</h1>
			          <p>Clara Oswald was a companion to the Eleventh Doctor. According to the Doctor,   Clara was simply "not possible". Though assured by the eminent empathic psychic   Emma Grayling and the TARDIS scanner that Clara was just an "ordinary girl", the   Doctor couldn't believe that to be true and thought her to be "the only mystery   worth solving".</p>
			          <p>In fact, the truth was somewhere in between. She was a physically ordinary   human girl from the 21st century, but one who had made an extraordinary   sacrifice to save the Doctor's life. Upholding a personal credo not to walk away   from danger in the service of others, she chose to enter the Doctor's timeline   in his tomb on Trenzalore in order to reverse the damage done to his timeline by   the Great Intelligence. This act allowed the time winds to break her into   millions of copies of herself that, according to River Song, weren't quite the   "real" Clara, but which were nevertheless capable of combatting the Great   Intelligence's attack. After her heroism revivified the Doctor, he then returned   the favour, guiding the original, 21st century Clara back out of his   timeline.</p>
		            <p>Still, this act of bravery by the "ordinary girl" — the 21st century original   — created the "impossible girl" who so intrigued the Doctor, largely by   repeatedly dying in front of him. It meant that the Doctor met her out of synch   with his own timeline, as had been the case with River and Mel. The Eleventh   Doctor alone met a couple of versions of her before meeting the original: Oswin   Oswald, a hyper-intelligent crew member onboard the Alaska who got converted   into a Dalek; and a barmaid-cum-nanny called Clara Oswin Oswald in Victorian era   London. Though her assistance mostly went unnoticed by Doctors prior to the   Eleventh, she met and subtly helped them all. Significantly, she was able to   attract the attention of the First Doctor and convince him to steal the "right"   TARDIS when he first left Gallifrey with   Susan.</p></TD>
