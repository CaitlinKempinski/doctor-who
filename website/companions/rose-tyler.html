			        <TD><h1>Rose Tyler</h1>
			          <p>When the Ninth Doctor first met her, Rose Tyler was a late teenager living on   a London council estate who had left school with little educational achievement.   Emotionally shaped by living with a promiscuous mother and stories about a   father whom she never knew, Rose seemed destined for a life as a retail   worker.</p>
			          <p>Instead, the Doctor blew up her workplace and they began travelling together   soon afterwards. Without trying, she helped the Doctor work through some of the   pain he had as the sole survivor of the Last Great Time War. Indeed, when she   met the Doctor, she was the girlfriend of Mickey Smith, but that relationship   immediately began to decay after she started travelling in the TARDIS. As Mickey   himself noted, she transferred her romantic attention to the Doctor.</p>
		            <p>A major facet of her travels in the TARDIS was the fact that she had caused a   temporal paradox by which she was the reason she became the so-called "Bad   Wolf". Leaving herself a trail of clues throughout history, she was able to   recognise, when all her hope had evaporated, that she needed to find her way   back to the Doctor — even though he had abandoned her and the TARDIS together.   Unable to actually fly the time machine, she was forced to simply stare into its   heart, which enfolded her in time vortex energy and turned her into a new and   seemingly omnipotent being that could rescue the Doctor. But it also nearly   killed her. Only the Ninth Doctor could absorb the time vortex energy and   transfer it back to the TARDIS — a traumatic act that naturally triggered   regeneration. She thus became one of only three companions — along with Peri   Brown and Wilfred Mott — to be the proximate cause of the Doctor's   regeneration.</p></TD>
