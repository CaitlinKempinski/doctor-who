			        <TD><h1>Rory Williams</h1>
			          <p>The son of his mother and his father, Brian Williams, Rory was born in 1989.   (COMIC: The Broken Man)</p>
			          <p>He was a childhood friend of Amelia Pond and grew up in the town of   Leadworth. Like much of Leadworth, he was privy to her tales of "the raggedy   Doctor," and he found himself a reluctant participant in dress-up games that she   based on them. (TV: The Eleventh Hour) The pair were also friends of Mels, who,   unbeknownst to them, was their daughter from the future.</p>
			          <p>In primary school, Rory was known as the school "freak" and "geek", with very   few friends other than Amelia and Mels. Amelia made him dress as "the raggedy   Doctor" at Halloween at one point during the 1990s.</p>
			          <p>While in third class, he was cast as Joseph in the school Nativity play.   (COMIC: Imaginary Enemies)</p>
		            <p>Rory also had a school friend called Alec, who used to play with Rory among   the branches of a willow tree in his garden, pretending it was eating them   alive, the bridge of the Starship Enterprise, caves that Indiana Jones would   explore or even a truck, which they'd throw themselves out, armed to the teeth   and catch bank robbers in the act. Alec disproved of Rory's chase after Amy and   claimed that there was a "whole barrage of girls" out there. Rory was always   there for Alec and when Alec had a heart attack and passed away, he supported   and comforted Alec's family, all throughout Alec's sickness and death. Ever   since, Rory disliked willow trees, because they reminded him of Alec. (PROSE:   The Glamour Chase)</p></TD>
