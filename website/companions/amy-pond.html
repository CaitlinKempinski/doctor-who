			        <TD><h1>Amy Pond</h1>
			          <p>Amelia Jessica "Amy" Pond, later Amy Williams, was the first companion of the   Doctor in his eleventh incarnation. She was the girlfriend and later wife of   nurse Rory Williams, and mother of Melody Pond, later be known as River Song.   When River married the Doctor, Amy became his mother-in-law. Amy died aged 87 at   some point prior to 2012 after allowing a Weeping Angel to send her back in   time, hoping to be reunited with her husband. She was buried beside Rory in a   graveyard in New York.</p>

			            Biography edit<BR>
			            Birth and early life edit<BR>
		              Amelia was   born in Scotland in 1989. Her parents, Augustus and Tabetha Pond, were swallowed   by the crack in her wall, and Amelia was raised by her aunt Sharon in the small   town of Leadworth. Despite living so long in England, she never lost her   Scottish accent. (TV: The Big Bang)</p>
			          <p>During her early years, Amy often went camping with her father in the   Highlands. (COMIC: Power of the Mykuootni)</p>
			          <p>Meeting the Doctor edit<BR>
		            Amelia first encountered the Eleventh Doctor and   her own adult self at a fair in 1994. She would not remember the Doctor, and   retained only a vague memory of the red-haired woman in the odd white dress (her   sleepwear), who bought her an ice cream cone to replace the one which she had   dropped, apparently immune to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect. Dropping and   losing the ice cream, and receiving the new one, would remain among her saddest   and happiest memories respectively. (HOMEVID: Good Night)</p></TD>
