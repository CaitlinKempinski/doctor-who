			          <p><STRONG>Portrayed by Tom Baker</STRONG></p>
			          <p>The Fourth Doctor was the fourth incarnation of the Time Lord known as the   Doctor. Filled with wanderlust and a renewed curiosity toward exploring time and   space, he left all ties of his previous incarnation's exile behind on Earth,   setting off to travel the cosmos. He initially travelled with Sarah Jane Smith   and Harry Sullivan, but Harry chose to remain on Earth when the opportunity   arose. The Doctor and Sarah continued on their adventures until the Doctor was   summoned to Gallifrey, necessitating that he leave Sarah Jane behind as humans   were not allowed on Gallifrey at that time.</p>
			          <p>After leaving Gallifrey, he met and travelled with Leela of the Sevateem.   During his travels with Leela, the Doctor gained a new companion in the robot   dog, K9. Returning once more to Gallifrey to stop an invasion, Leela and the   original K9 stayed behind there. On the White Guardian's orders, the Doctor   began looking for the Key to Time with fellow Time Lady Romana and K9 Mark II.   Once that search was concluded, the Doctor and a newly-regenerated Romana went   on the run from the Black Guardian. They accidentally passed into the smaller   universe of E-Space.</p>
			          <p>During his travels in E-Space, the Doctor gained a new companion in the   teenaged mathematical genius Adric. Romana and K9 stayed behind in E-Space as   the Doctor and Adric departed for N-Space. There, they encountered a Trakenite   princess named Nyssa and a human Tegan. The foursome successfully prevented the   destruction of the universe by the Master â€” but only at the cost of this   incarnation's life.</p></TD>
