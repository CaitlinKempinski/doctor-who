			          <p><STRONG>Portrayed by Paul McGann</STRONG></p>
			          <p>The Eighth Doctor made his first television appearance in the 1996 Doctor Who   television movie, the first time the Doctor had returned to television screens   since the end of the original series in 1989. Intended as a backdoor pilot for a   new television series on the Fox Network, the movie managed to draw 5.5% of the   US audience, according to Nielsen Ratings.[1] In the United Kingdom, it was   received well, attracting over 9 million viewers and generally positive reviews.   It was also generally well received in Australia.[2]</p>
			          <p><BR>
			            Although the movie failed to spark a new television series, the Eighth   Doctor's adventures continued in various licensed spin-off media, notably BBC   Books' Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, audio plays from Big Finish Productions,   and the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip. These stories spanned the nine years   between 1996 and the debut of the new television series in 2005. He is   unarguably the longest-serving Doctor in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip. In   the wake of the positive reaction to the revived television series in 2005,   several of the Eighth Doctor's Big Finish audio dramas were also broadcast on   BBC7 radio in an edited form. The trailers for these broadcasts explained that   these adventures took place before the destruction of Gallifrey as described in   the revived TV series. In 2007, BBC7 aired a new series of Eighth Doctor audio   adventures, created specifically for radio broadcast. Paul McGann has continued   to portray the Eighth Doctor in the various audio spinoffs.</p>
			          <p><BR>
			            The canonicity of the spin-off media with respect to the television   series and to each other is open to interpretation (the "Beginner's Guide to   Doctor Who" on the BBC's classic Doctor Who website suggests this may be due to   the Time War).[3] It has been suggested that the Eighth Doctor's adventures in   three different forms (novels, audio, and comics) take place in three separate   continuities. The discontinuities were made explicit in the audio drama   Zagreus.[4] In response, it has become increasingly common to consider the three   ranges separately. The final Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, The Gallifrey   Chronicles, obliquely references this split in timelines, even suggesting that   the split results in the three alternative forms of the Ninth Doctor (a   reference to the fact three different versions of the incarnation have appeared   in various media). Mary's Story, a 2009 audio story by Big Finish, contradicted   these suggestions, as there the Doctor mentions his companions in order, with   book companions before audio companions. Ultimately, however, all matters of   canonicity remain typically   unclear.</p></TD>
