			          <p><STRONG>Portrayed by David Tennant</STRONG></p>
			          <p>The Tenth Doctor generally displays a light-hearted, talkative, easy-going,   witty, and cheeky manner, but repeatedly demonstrates a vengeful and unforgiving   streak as well. This emerged early on when he sends the Sycorax leader (who is   attacking him from behind) falling to his death while commenting that, with him,   there are "no second chances".[16] In "School Reunion", he acknowledges that he   is less merciful than he used to be and has stuck to his "one warning" code,   punishing his enemies if they persist in their hostilities. This is demonstrated   in "The Runaway Bride" when he drowns the Empress of Racnoss' children and   stoically watches on, prompting Donna Noble to declare that he needs somebody to   stop him, and in "The Family of Blood" where he gives each Family member an   individual and eternal punishment. His strong personal sense of justice makes   him quick to anger when he feels it is violated, as in "New Earth" when he   learns of the plague farm run by the Sisters of Plenitude, he brings down their   entire operation. When Prime Minister Harriet Jones gives an order to destroy   the retreating Sycorax ship against his intentions, he brings down her   government in six words, "Don't you think she looks tired?", which reaches the   press via her assistant's headset. In "The Waters of Mars", he goes so far as to   declare himself above the laws of time, although there are catastrophic   consequences as a result.</p>
			          <p><BR>
			            This is coupled, however, with an intense sense of   regret of the deaths of both his friends and enemies. In "Journey's End", he has   a flashback of those who have died instead of/for him, including Astrid Peth,   Jenny, Luke Rattigan, Lynda Moss, and the hostess from "Midnight". He also   offers Davros the chance to escape the destruction of the Dalek mothership, but   Davros spits the chance back at him, calling him the "Destroyer of Worlds". A   recurring line on the part of the Tenth Doctor is his saying that he is "so   sorry" for actions he takes, even as he takes them. The loss of his companions   and people he befriended becomes a sensitive issue and a mere mention may   trigger a sudden outburst of anger without warning. In "The Doctor's Daughter"   he explains to his daughter Jenny how "killing...infects [you] and once it does   you'll never get rid of it" and that the worst part of it was that he "became   clever", reflecting on his involvement in the Time War and witnessing the   destruction of his own kind, friends and enemies.</p>
			          <p><BR>
			            The Tenth Doctor has a   tendency to babble, mixing apparent nonsense with vital information, sometimes   acting erratically to put his enemies off-guard. He is prone to making comments   that to outsiders seem obtuse or rude, sometimes to his own embarrassment. In   "The Christmas Invasion" and "Tooth and Claw", he is surprised at his own   unintentional rudeness when making disparaging remarks, and Jack Harkness, after   reuniting with the Doctor, notes that his "new regeneration (is) kinda   cheeky".[17] He has a tendency to use technobabble to describe scientific   concepts before substituting it with a simpler, analogous explanation, such as   his description of non-linear temporal physics as "a big ball of wibbly wobbly,   timey wimey stuff".[18] He is also able to rapidly switch between moods, from   mania to anger to nonchalance and uses this as a form of reverse psychology on   several occasions ("Fear Her", "Love &amp; Monsters" and "Army of Ghosts"). In   the latter, by switching gears suddenly after failing to dissuade Yvonne Hartman   from her current activities, he is able to make her uncertain enough to get his   way.</p></TD>
