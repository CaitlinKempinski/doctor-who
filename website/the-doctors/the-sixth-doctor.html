			          <p><STRONG>Portrayed by Colin Baker</STRONG></p>
			          <p>The Sixth Doctor was the sixth incarnation of the Time Lord known as the   Doctor. Arrogant, careless, dramatic, self-absorbed, driven and stubborn, the   sixth incarnation instantly believed himself superior to almost anyone he   encountered. Nevertheless, he did possess great reserves of compassion, which   occasionally shone through. As he grew older, these traits began to supersede   his fits of egomania.</p>
			          <p>With his travels with Peri, the Doctor was always dominant in the   decision-making and what he did. This often led to his actions being questioned   as they mostly seemed like they were for the wrong reason. (TV: The Twin Dilemma   - Mindwarp) When Mel joined him later, the Doctor was forced to partake in a   diet and exercise regimen, taking on the reversed role.</p>
			          <p>By this time, he had mellowed from his original unstable self, even to the   point of not interfering unless asked to do so. (TV: Terror of the Vervoids)</p></TD>
