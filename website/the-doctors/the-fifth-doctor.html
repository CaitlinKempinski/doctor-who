			          <p><STRONG>Portrayed by Peter Davison</STRONG></p>
			          <p>The Fifth Doctor was the fifth incarnation of the Time Lord known as the   Doctor. He looked younger than his predecessors and expressed a new, more human   aspect of his alien nature. Although it made him remarkably kinder, he became   more fettered to the violent aspects of his travels.</p>
			          <p>He began with three companions: Adric, Nyssa and Tegan Jovanka. All had   joined the TARDIS crew towards the end of his previous incarnation. His   relationship with Adric grew rocky due to their lack of common interests. After   the Cybermen's attack on Earth in the 26th century, the Doctor felt guilty over   Adric's death and his inability to save his friend. The Doctor took Nyssa in   after the Master destroyed Traken. He gave her a home in the TARDIS until she   left to find a cure for Lazar's disease. The Doctor tried repeatedly to return   Tegan to Heathrow Airport in the early 1980s. He succeeded eventually but she   soon rejoined him. They parted finally when she grew weary of the death and   destruction the TARDIS crew continually found themselves amidst.</p>
			          <p>The Black Guardian pursued the Fifth Doctor and sent Turlough to kill him.   However, the Doctor won over Turlough and defeated the Guardian. Turlough   accompanied the Doctor until his exile from his home ended. In an encounter with   the Master, the Doctor gained a companion in the shape-changing android   Kamelion. However, the Doctor eventually complied with Kamelion's wish to be   destroyed.</p></TD>
