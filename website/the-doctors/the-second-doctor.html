			  <H1>The Second Doctor</H1>
              <p><STRONG>Portrayed by Patrick Troughton</STRONG></p>
              <p>The Second Doctor was the second incarnation of the Time Lord known as the   Doctor. Though outwardly warm, bumbling, and somewhat clownish, this version of   the Doctor had a darker, more cunning aspect to his personality â€” one which he   usually kept hidden in order to better carry out his plans.</p>
              <p>He travelled with a number of companions. He had several adventures with his   previous incarnation's last companions, Ben Jackson and Polly Wright, before   adding Highland Scot Jamie McCrimmon to the mix. After a while, Ben and Polly   left, to be replaced by Victoria Waterfield, a woman orphaned by the Daleks. In   time, she too left, and the Doctor made a new friend in the mentally gifted Zoe   Heriot. At some point he also travelled with his grandchildren, John and   Gillian.</p>
              <p>His adventures came to an end when he at last called on his people for help   with the evil machinations of the War Lord. Though the Time Lords did indeed   render assistance, they also condemned him to exile on Earth and a new body. The   Celestial Intervention Agency was able to stay the execution of this sentence   for a while. During these later years of his life, the Second Doctor variously   carried out covert operations for the CIA and lived in luxury and fame in the   heart of 1960s London. Eventually, though, Time Lord justice reasserted itself,   and the Doctor was indeed forced to regenerate into his third body.</p>
