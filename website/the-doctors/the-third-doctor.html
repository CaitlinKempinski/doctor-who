			          <p><STRONG>Portrayed by Jon Pertwee</STRONG></p>
			          <p>The Third Doctor was the third incarnation of the Time Lord known as the   Doctor. He was exiled by the Time Lords on Earth for much of his life. The   technological limits of the time period often made him frustrated and bitter.   However, he retained his endearing compassion toward human companions.</p>
			          <p>This Doctor worked for UNIT as their unpaid scientific advisor. He remained   in their service even after his exile was ended. Unlike his earlier   incarnations, he was eager to engage others physically. He also cut a more   dashing figure.</p>
			          <p>In the field, the Doctor was aided by Sergeant Benton, Captain Mike Yates and   most notably the Brigadier. The Doctor did not get along well with the Brig at   first, but they ultimately developed an easy mutual trust and became good   friends.</p></TD>
