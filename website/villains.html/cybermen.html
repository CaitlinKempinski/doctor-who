                                	<p><img src="../images/villains/cybermen.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="">Cybermen were originally a wholly organic species of  humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas that began to implant more  and more artificial parts into their bodies. This led to the race becoming  coldly logical and calculating cyborgs, with emotions usually only shown when  naked aggression was called for. With the demise of Mondas, they acquired Telos  as their new home planet. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the  Doctor Who franchise.</p>
							<p>The 2006 series introduced a totally new variation of  Cybermen. These Cybus Cybermen were created in a parallel universe by the mad  inventor John Lumic; he was attempting to preserve the life of a human by  transplanting their brains into powerful metal bodies, sending them orders  using a mobile phone network and inhibiting their emotions with an electronic  chip. In November 2012, Neil Gaiman confirmed that the Cybermen would feature  in an upcoming series 7 episode he has written.[100] This episode,  &quot;Nightmare in Silver, was broadcast in 2013.</p>
